## Team Name: TBD




## Group Project: Team Agreement

### The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week

> Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.
Planning
Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.
Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.
Deliverable
Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file, and include the following components in your team agreement submission.

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

* **Morning Stand Up:**
* Are there any merges outstanding
* Git pull origin main to make sure we’re in the same place
* Plan the timeline based on the structure of the project
* Meet hourly in the beginning to check in as a group
* Check if there are any merges
* Merge branches often so we are coordinated and nothing changes too drastically.

* **Lunch**

* End of day
* Git pull origin main at the end of the working day
* 9am - 6 pm PST working day
* Take breaks when needed

### NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here

#### Conflict Plan

#### Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary

#### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

* Open communication: Honest, clear, feeling comfortable taking risks to clear the air, no grudges
* Timeouts - Walk away when things get heated so they don’t escalate
* Grab another member to mediate in the group

#### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

* Respectfully draw their attention to the behavior and give them an opportunity to wrap up their thought.
* Hand off the conversation to another person.
* How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
* Ask questions
* Preschool mindset
* Be cool

#### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

* Open communication
* Be direct with that person
* If all else fails Ian will rule with an iron fist.

#### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

* Consult Alex

### Communication Plan

#### Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up


#### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

- Slack

#### How often will you take breaks?

* As needed
* At minimum, one hour

#### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

* Communication
* Utilize TA support
* Reach out to Alex
* Focus on the MVP - SIMPLIFY FROM THE START

#### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

* Slack for things that can be handled by anyone in the group when we return to work, or asap
* Text: For things that can be responded to within an hour
* Call: For immediate emergency communication

#### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

* Preschool mindset

#### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

* Genuine/natural conversation

### Work Plan

#### Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts

#### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

* Utilize Trello board 
* Morning huddle
* End of day huddle

#### What project management tool will be used?

* Slack: for team communication
* Google Docs: for planning and file management 
* Project Management Tool: Trello
* Excallidraw
* Github: for collateral materials (i.e., pics, etc.)

#### Presentation Deck

Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.
Link to the shared doc in your project plan.


### Schedule your practice session - 

#### Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team

### Git Process

#### Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks

#### What components of your project will live on GitHub?

* Organization/Repositories/assets

#### How will you share the repository with your teammates?

* Merge early and often and on schedule
* Anytime we have a working piece of the project, we should seek to merge.

#### What is your Git flow?

* Branch on individual branch
* Git Pull Origin Main to sync baches
* Merge and Pull request when we have working code
* Git pull origin main to sync branches

#### Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider

* How many people must review a PR? 2
* Who merges PRs? Subject matter expert & person who wrote the code (alt. PM)
* How often will you merge? Anytime we have working code for a piece of the project
* How will you communicate that it’s time to merge? - Video chat in Remo.
